## Information!
The work I've done is in `wwacodingenvxblock/wwacodingenvxblock/static/`  
There are also other folders:
- var
- venv
- xblock-sdk

Check the XBlock Documentation for more information on those.  
`venv` and `xblock-sdk` contain `.gitignore` files, so they are not included in the repository.  
`var` seems to just contain logs or something, I've decided to also gitignore it.

Also check out `HowToStartThing.txt`...
